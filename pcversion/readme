PC Version of Fragstats

The PC version of fragstats will only run on a 386 or better
machine.  A math coprocessor is also required.  It should
run under DOS or Windows.

Fragstats will use disk space to allocate virtual memory.
The environmental variable TEMP must be set to tell the 
program where to allocate the swap file, e.g.:
	
	SET TEMP=C:\tmp


Run the PC version of fragstats exactly the same way as the
Unix version.
