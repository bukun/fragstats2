	The documentation distributed electronically is not the
most up-to-date.  There are a few figures that need to be updated, 
and the discussion of the way background is handled is not correct.
However, current documentation is available -- the fragstats
manual is now available as a PNW Forest Service Technical Report
and can be obtained by calling (503) 326-7128 and requesting a
copy of report PNW-GTR-351.

	I have done some limited testing with fragstats in 
arc/info version 7.0 and it now appears to work (after modifying
one of the C programs).  Let me know if you have any trouble:

	I have removed the directories raster, vector, man, and 
pcversion.  I realize what a pain it was to "cd" to each subdirectory
and "mget *".  All the software is now contained in one tar or pkzip
file.   The directory structure has been preserved in these files.

    *  get frag.tar if you are ftp'ing from a Unix machine
	    to extract the files:
		 tar xvf frag.tar 

    *  get frag.zip if you are ftp'ing from a DOS machine
            to extract the files:
		 pkunzip -d frag.zip

	   ("pkunzip.exe" is also available from this 
             directory if you need it)


Remember to set the mode to binary!

	Also note that a postscript printer is required to print the 
documentation files in the "man" directory.

If the landscape you are working with has background (area outside
the landscape of interest) please read this:




	Fragstats expects a positive value for background to be
entered at the prompt "Enter value for background".  Fragstats expects
background patches inside the landscape to be set to a positive value
and those outside the landscape and in the landscape border to be set
to the negative of this value.  If your landscape has no interior 
background patches, but all cells outside the landscape of interest
have been set to -9999, you must still enter 9999 at the prompt. 

	I have found this postive/negative background convention
difficult to follow sometimes.  In many of the images I have worked
with lately, all background has been classified to one value, 
regardless of whether is interior or exterior to the landscape of 
interest.  Therefore, I made the following changes to fragstats:

	If only one type of background is found when reading in the 
image (only interior or only exterior background), fragstats will now
verify that each patch has been classified correctly.  If fragstats 
finds that an interior background patch has been incorrectly classified 
as exterior background, it will be re-classified as interior background 
and a message will be issued.  Incorrectly classified interior background
patches will also be re-classified as exterior, if necessary.  A warning
will be issued about any questionable patches (background patches along
the landscpae boundary).  

	If background patches along the landscape boundary are not
classified correctly, the following indices may not be calculated
correctly (class and landscape level):  landscape shape index, total
edge, edge density, contrast weighted edge density, and total edge
contrast index.  Beware!

			    FRAGSTATS 2.0


	The 2.0 release of FRAGSTATS differs from the previous version in
only minor ways, yet because so many files were modified, we felt a new
release was in order.  Several "bugs" have been corrected.  The most important
change is the added option to treat a specified proportion of the landscape
boundary and background edge (instead of just all or none) as true edge in the 
edge metrics.  This fraction is also used as the edge contrast weight for
landscape boundary and background edge segments in the calculation of edge
contrast metrics.  In addition, the convention for naming the output file
containing patch ID's in the raster version has been modified to comply with
DOS requirements.  Similarly, the output file name extensions in PC raster
version only have been shortened and renamed to comply with DOS requirements
and to avoid conflicts with ERDAS naming conventions.  The nearest neighbor
algorithm has been modified slightly to compute actual edge-to-edge distance
(previous version used cell midpoints rather than edge).

	We hope that FRAGSTATS is of great assistance to you in your work!
